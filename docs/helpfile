##Background
The publication database contains metadata about all papers produced by the Norwegian Polar Institute's employees. The employees fill in metadata about their own papers and the database is used when searching for papers and statistics about NPI research production.

##Login
To enter a new publication in the database – or to update/edit a previous entry – start by logging in to
[Norwegian Polar Institute Publication Database](https://data.npolar.no/publication). The login button is located in the upper right corner (a "user menu"-icon (se picture below). Note - the credentials differ from the NPI network login. If you do not have a data.npolar.no account, please [contact us](https://github.com/npolar/npdc-publication/wiki/helpfile#contact). If you know your login name but have forgotten your password, you can use the button "email code" (under the "user menu"-icon). Then you will receive a one-time password as an email. Click on the submitted link to log in. To see if you are really logged in, hover the mouse over the "user menu"-icon. If logged in, you will see "<your name> user".

When logged in, select "Publications" in the navigations menu ("cube"-icon, third button from top right).

##Tabs
###Title&ID
**DOI:** When you have opened the publication for editing, start by filling in the DOI if applicable. An example of a DOI: "10.1016/j.coldregions.2016.06.006". Some journals write DOIs as "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2016.06.006". If so, please do NOT include the prefix "http://dx.doi.org/" since it is only the resolver web address.

A DOI is a permanent id to a paper, dataset or similar. That means if you have the DOI, you should be able to put "http://dx.doi.org/" in front of it, put it in the browser link search field and receive the paper. F.ex. to search for DOI 10.1016/j.coldregions.2016.06.006 you use link "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2016.06.006" for search.

Fill in DOI and save (green button "disk-icon" to the right, see below). Refresh page and now you should be able to see you title automatically filled in. If you receive an error message or nothing happens, something has gone wrong. If so, contact the Environmental Data Section. If necessary, you may have to fill in the information manually.

##Frequently asked questions
###1) Why is my publication not showing on my NPI employee page?
All NPI employees have their own [home page](http://www.npolar.no/en/people/). In order to make a publication visible in your NPI employee page, go to "edit" and select tab "people", field "email" and add your login name here. It is important that it is your login name and not another e-mail address you use. Save and now the paper should be included under "Publications" on your NPI employee page. See also 4).

###2) Why is my publication not showing in the NPI search?
If you search [the NPI search](http://www.npolar.no/en/publications/), your publication should be included in the list if it is an NPI publication and thus also be included in the NPI annual report. The criteria for being an NPI publication is that NPI has supported the project financially or by salary so you could finish the activity/paper. If so go to "edit" and tab "organisations", field "id" and add "npolar.no" to the list of organisations. Set tab "organisations", field "roles" to "originator". See also 4).

###3) Why is my publication not showing in our section search?
If you search [the NPI search](http://www.npolar.no/en/publications/) and filter on f.ex. programme "Biodiversity", you should get a section list over publications. To get your paper included in the section list, go to "edit" and tab "Metadata", field "Programmes" and fill in the section(s) that apply. See also 4).

###4) Why does my paper not show up at all on Internet/ why can't I find my paper when I want to edit it?
Remember to log in to [the Norwegian Polar Data Center](https://data.npolar.no/home/). Search for your paper, go to "edit", tab "metadata", field "draft". If this field is set to "yes", the paper will not be visible on the Internet at all, only on the Intranet if you are logged in.
